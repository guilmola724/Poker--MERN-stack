          This website contains links to external websites of third parties, the
          content of which the operator has no influence on. Therefore, the
          operator cannot accept any liability for this third-party content. The

          the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
          possible legal violations at the time the link was created. No illegal
          content was discernible at the time the link was created. A permanent
          control of the content of the linked websites is not reasonable
          without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of
          rights violations, such links will be removed promptly.
